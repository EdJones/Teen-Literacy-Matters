# (Black) Teen Literacy Matters
### A first-of-a-kind Industry Credential

This project creates a new [industry credential](https://education.ohio.gov/Topics/Ohio-s-Graduation-Requirements/Contacts-and-Resources/Industry-Recognized-Credentials/Industry-Recognized-Credentials-by-Career-Field) for high school students. 

It is also the prototype project for an entirely [new approach to developing teen curricula](https://skunkworks-edu.com/#transparency), and to [setting specific teen learning goals](https://medium.com/@creditflex/pillars-of-a-hacked-high-school-experience-784ea60fd851).

This credential is the result of over a [decade of R&D](https://skunkworks-edu.com) into how we can [redesign high schools](https://fordhaminstitute.org/national/commentary/wonkathon-2022-we-must-reinvent-high-schools-state-policies-stand-way-how-do-we). 

It specifically addresses two workforce issues:
1. The inequitable teaching of literacy in K-3, and the lifelong consequences.
2. The abysmal shortage of Black teacher candiates. 

As a prototype, it will help iterate entirely new processes for developing, testing, and fielding such credentialed learning.
